Engine
- Fixed $DTM(M) displaying month-1
- Added support for "URL" incoming header filters

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2.5
-------------

Proxy
- Support for URL commands
- HTML debug info (to allow filter designers to troubleshoot their filters)

GUI
- Imported Proxomitron filters are activated in the edited configuration if they
  were active in the Proxomitron file.

Engine
- Hashing of blocklist entries that start with a constant string (e.g. foo*,
  but not *foo, or even [fg]oo).  Unhashed entries are checked sequentially as
  before.  Proxomitron's 'NoHash' hint has no effect.
- Added recognition of ~ patterns in lists


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2.4 (July 20th, 2005)
-------------

Engine
- URL pseudo-headers now always work (detection was case-sensitive)
- Improved processing (less function calls while scanning text)
- Bug fix: pattern "(f*)\1bar" was not matching "foobar"
- There is now only 1 buffer, shared by all filters (like in Proxomitron)
- The "Allow Multiple Match" indicator now has the same meaning as in Proxomitron

GUI
- Wider "active configuration" field on Monitor screen
- Better synchronization between filter edition window and config window
- Profile button in filter test dialog; shows input length, number of matches,
  average time per run, approximate data throughput in kbps

Proxy
- Fixed freezing on 304 responses
- SSL tunneling (https can now go through Proximodo, though not filtered)

Other
- Replaced many includes by forward declarations, to reduce dependencies
- Sources now compile with Visual C++

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2.3 (Apr 20th, 2005)
-------------

Engine
- Bypass URL and URL Match now work like in Proxomitron
- Fixed $TYPE() which was causing hangings

Proxy
- Don't reorder or concatenate headers (cookies must not be concatenated!)
- Idle persistent connections expire after 10 seconds

GUI
- Created a monitoring screen, with checkboxes, statistics and abort button
- Can run any external program when Proximodo starts
- Opening default browser on start-up should now work fine under Linux
- Compatibility with wxWidgets 2.5.4
- Changed colors and font in Log window
- Simplified internal management of windows
- Fixed bad drag&drop in config tree

Other
- Invalid filters are now loaded too
- Eliminated memory leaks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2.1 (Jan 8th, 2005)
-------------

Engine
- Content of $RDIR and $JUMP is now expanded
- "URL" header filters will scan the URL _including_ the http://
- $TST won't match if variable is empty
- Added usage of \k in text filters
- Added $TST((expandedText)=pattern) and $TST((expandedText))
- Note: unknown commands being ignored, you can use $NOP(some comment text)
- stars are now optional in [#n:n] and {n,n}
- Added [%nn-%nn]  [%nn-z]  and  [z-%nn]  (all are case-sensitive)
- In [], \char is now case-sensitive: [\A-Z] will match uppercase letters only
- Added fixed-size virtual lists

Proxy
- Can process request/response with LF instead of CRLF
- Improved URL redir code
- Redirections by incoming headers are limited to 3 (to avoid infinite loop)
- Improved compatibility with Internet Explorer

GUI
- Added an option to start a browser automatically

Other
- Fixed bad management of config names containing a comma
- Installer has an option to set IE proxy automatically


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2 (Nov 28th, 2004)
-----------

GUI
- Turned config list into a tree with checkable items
- Made the filter edition screen a non-modal window accessible from config screen
- Reorganized items on Filters window, to make the window fit in 800x600 desktop
- Added 'priority' as a filter property

Proxy
- Reordered proxy code to improve stability (still some images are randomly broken in IE)
- Headers now get reordered (in HTTP RFC recommended order)

Engine
- Fixed $FILTER command ('true' and 'false' were inverted)
- Header filters with "*" and "\digit" pattern will not match an empty header
- Filters are now executed in 'Priority" order, instead of display order
- Recognizes ^ notation at beginning of pattern
- Added infinite-loop protection in "+" notation
- Added [%nn] notation (case-sensitive)

Config files
- Filters now have an ID and Folder ID (both invisible in GUI) to retain config structure
- Folders are recorded in settings.txt using Folders= lines
- Configs are now recorded using filters' IDs
- Changed 'Lists' to 'lists' in settings.txt to be case-consistent with folder
- Title= no more needed in filters.txt

Other
- Made filenames respect OS directory separator char
- A #include was missing in trayicon.cpp
