Installing Proximodo on Mandrake 10.1
-------------------------------------

Written by Griptypethyne.
Version 2    24/4/05   (wxGTK 2.6.0 & gtk 2.4.9)
Version 1.1  27/3/05  ( wxWidgets 2.5.4 & gtk 1.2.10)

Follow these steps in the order given to compile and run Proximodo. 


************************** A. Check GCC Version ********************************************

Proximodo will compile with gcc 3.4.1.
  
I received syntax errors when using gcc 3.3. The errors were in gcc file mathcalls.h. I do not know if the errors were caused by gcc 3.3 or some other problem.  Note that it was at a very early stage in my efforts to compile Proximodo.
 

********************  B. Install  GTK2 ******************************************************

Use rpmdrake to install:
	gtk+2.0-2.4.9-9.1.101mdk
	libgtk+2.0_0-devel-2.4.9-9.1.101mdk

I also have libgtk+2.0_0-2.4.9-9.1.101mdk installed. Not sure if it is needed. It may have been installed as a dependant file of the -devel- package. I think that it is the runtime libraries (dynamic linking). 

GTK2 does not use gtk-config. It uses uses pkg-config instead.

From a terminal run
	pkg-config gtk+-2.0  --modversion

and confirm that it returns 2.4.9

The development package of libgtk is required because in the next step wxGTK will be installed and compiled from source. If someone creates a development package (binaries + headers) for wxGTK 2.6.0 then I assume that a libgtk binary only package would be sufficient i.e. the headers would not be needed.


********************  C. Install wxGTK  with GTK2 ************************************************

Go to  http://www.wxwidgets.org  -> Downloads and download 

	wxGTK-2.6.0.tar.bz2

Open a terminal and su root. Then enter the following:

	tar -zxvf wxGTK-2.6.0.tar.bz2		//To unzip the files.
	cd /wxWidgets-2.6.0			//Unzipped files are placed in this directory.
	./configure â€“enable-log			//Defaults are log off & with-gtk=2.
	make clean				//If a previous make has failed.
	make					//Be patient - it will finish without errors!
	make install
	ldconfig

Notes:
	(a) Do not need to set CFLAGS or LDFLAGS to install wxGTK 2.6.0 because ./configure uses pkg-config to set the flags.
	(b) log is off by default when running  ./configure.
	(c) Use ./configure --with-gtk=1 if gtk2 is not installed.

Note:  If someone creates a development package (binaries + headers) for wxGTK 2.6.0 then I assume that you could install that package rather than compiling wxGTKs from source. The wxGTK headers are needed so that Proximodo can be compiled.


************************* E. Compile Proximodo ************************************************

Download the Proximodo source package and unzip to <Proximodo source path>.

Open a terminal:

	<wxGTK path>/wxGTK-2.6.0/wx-config --version	//Make sure result is 2.6.0
	<wxGTK path>/wxGTK-2.6.0/wx-config --cxxflags 	//Set WXINC_REL in Proximodo Makefile	
	<wxGTK path>/wxGTK-2.6.0/wx-config --libs 	//Set WXLIB_REL in Proximodo Makefile
	
Open Proximodo Makefile in a text editor and follow the instructions to set WXINC_REL & WXLIB_REL, using the values obtained above.

In a termnal enter:
	cd <Proximodo source path>
	make       
              
The Proximodo executable can now be found in <Proximodo source path>/distrib

Notes: 

(a) I unzipped the Proximodo source to my /home directory. As a result the Proximodo binary installed in /home/<middle part of path>/src/distrib and so I did not need to su root. Maybe it would be better to edit Makefile so that the binary is placed in /usr/Proximodo, in which case it would be necessary to su root.

(b) Create a file proximodo.compile.sh:

	#!/bin/sh
	cd /home/dad/SetUpLinux/Proximodo/src
	make distrib/proximodo

(c) Important: Make sure that you are using the correct version of wx-config - I have at least four copies on my system.


*************************  F.  Linux Path Conventions ********************************************

cd <Proximodo source path>/distrib

Open file settings.txt in a text editor and change the "\" to "/" in the list-file names.


************************* G.  Run Proximodo ****************************************************

Create a shell script proximodo.sh to run Proximodo:

	#!/bin/sh
	cd <path>/src/distrib 
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/X11R6/lib
	./proximodo&

You may wish to experiment to determine which of the export statements is required.


********************** H. Changes to Proximodo Source ****************************************

If you make changes to a Proximodo source file you can compile just the changed file (and save time) by entering

	cd <Proximodo source path>
	make distrib/proximodo

To force a compile of all files enter

	cd <Proximodo source path>
	make clean
	make 

Note: Testing changes is quick and easy:

Open source file in kwrite (or your favourite editor - I recommend kwrite). 
Make and save changes.

In a terminal:
	cd <Proximodo script path>
	./proximodo.compile.sh
	./proximodo.sh


***************** I. Known Problems   *****************************************************

(a) Fixed in wxGTK2.6.0 - The mouse wheel works only when the cursor is in the vertical slider. It does not work if the cursor is in the window.

(b) Does not work in GTK2.6.0 - The GetOpenCommand function does not work so the browser cannot be opened and help pages displayed.Proximodo opens a message window when this occurs.
