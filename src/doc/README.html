<h2><a href="#toc" name="ideas">Ideas behind Proximodo</a></h2>

<p>The main idea is to provide a free and open alternative to the
excellent but alas now unmaintained Proxomitron. I hope that in a
near future Proximodo will implement all functionalities of
Proxomitron 4.5, and more. Currently, 100% of Proxomitron $commands
and syntax are supported, so you can use all your custom filters
with Proximodo!</p>

<p>Also, the first version (0.1) of Proximodo already offers new
functionalities, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multilingual GUI</li>

<li>Multiplatform (thanks to wxWidgets and no use of Windows
specific libraries)</li>

<li>Centralized bank of filter: Proxomitron's .cfg files are
replaced by mere enumerations of active filters, i.e
"Configurations"</li>

<li>Export/Import filters from/to clipboard (no more need to mess
with .txt files)</li>

<li>Import from Proxomitron filters (again through clipboard)</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="#toc" name="missing">Missing options still to be
developed</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>HTML debug info (but do we want it?)</li>

<li>SSL support (https)</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="#toc" name="issues">Known issues</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>While gzip/deflate output works most of the time, there seem
to be a few pages that get corrupted when compressed. In this case
the browser asks the website for the missing pieces, and the latter
returns a 206 response that is not correctly appended into the
browser. Example: http://www.calgarytransit.com/ and create a
filter force incoming header Content-Encoding to gzip (or deflate).
</li>

<li>In some cases, web page retrieval does not behave the same when
using a next proxy or not. Example: groups.yahoo.com will return a
302 response with an invalid Location header, which is not the case
when the browser connects directly to the internet or through
another proxy server.</li>

<li>There is a lot of flickering when resizing the window. It is a
known issue of wxWidgets. I have not yet figured out a way to get rid
of it without loosing in code clarity.</li>

<li>There are some redrawing glitches in the GUI, again on resize.
I think they should disappear with the next stable release of wxMSW
(release 2.5.3 is still under development.)</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="#toc" name="framework">Framework</a></h2>

<p>I chose wxWidgets for GUI and sockets. I used wxMSW 2.5.3 for
developing v0.1, so due to backward compatibility issues the code
may not compile or work properly with earlier versions of
wxWidgets (for example, earlier versions won't display the popup
menu of the wxTaskBar).</p>

<p>I use C++ STL wherever possible (as long as it does not make
code unreadable). In particular, string is used instead of char[]
as much as possible.</p>

<p>Proximodo does not use standard C libraries, only pure C++.</p>

<p>I did not compile wxMSW with STL wxString inheritance, I am not
sure it would have been better, but as for now there are .c_str()
calls at every conversions between wxString and string.</p>

<h2><a href="#toc" name="notes">Other notes on development
choices</a></h2>

<p><b>Case sensitivity:</b> Header names and $SET variable names
are case-insensitive. List names and configuration
names are case-sensitive. In pattern, everything is case-insensitive
except [%xx] and [\letter].</p>

<h2><a href="#toc" name="help">Want to participate?</a></h2>

<p>If you are willing to participate in Proximodo's development,
you are very welcome. Parts that most need help:</p>

<ul>
<li>Testing (engine/proxy/GUI)</li>

<li>Debugging and tracking memory leaks (if any)</li>

<li>Completing help pages</li>

<li>Translating help pages and .lng files to other languages</li>

<li>Porting to other platforms (I don't have Linux installed right
now, but a Knoppix distro)</li>

<li>Creating a nice website</li>

<li>Developping new or missing options</li>
</ul>

<p>All your suggestions, encouragements or even flaming will be
welcome!</p>
