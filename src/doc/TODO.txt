GUI:

- Menu option to import a whole Proxomitron configuration (filters, config, lists, proxies, options)
- Move filtering checkboxes and active config dropdown to welcome screen
- Add 'Abort' button and proxy status info on welcome screen
- Button to come back to welcome screen
- Design an "Add to List" dialog
- Use this dialog in tray icon, and for $ADDLSTBOX()
- Make very minor changes in code so that it compiles and runs smoothly on Mac, Linux or Unix platforms
- Generate .PAC files for easy proxy changes in browsers
- Stealth mode for use on public computers (or password on tray icon usage? must be secure)
- Additional test window with Pattern field, for testing some expression instead of current filter

Engine:

- Estimate and improve performance and stability
- Some syntax for commenting inside a pattern
- Command for inserting application-defined variables in replace pattern (ex: filter name, listening port....)
- \x and URL commands will not be implemented (they are called 'vestigial' by Scott)
- \d macro for [0-9]
- New commands: $INC(var[,num]) $DEC(var) $ADD(var,pattern) $MUL(var,pattern)

Proxy:

- Find why some images don't load (best example: Images section on Altavista -> no image loads at all)
- Next proxy login/password settings
- Persistent connections should expire after n seconds
- Support for 206 response code
- Fix gzip/deflate output, that seems to be corrupted after a few KB (use another zlib version?)
- HTML debug info
- maximum HTTP 1.1 compliance
- HTTP 1.0 option
- SSL support (https)
- Let FTP through (currently, only works when HTTP request is redirected to next proxy)
- Act as a real proxy when not forwarding to a next proxy
- Add more %%name%% variables for html error page
- Add a way to have specific filters be the only ones to act on specific URLs (e.g if the URL
  matches the 'Specific URL' pattern of 1+ filters, all other non-matching filters are bypassed)

Distributing:

- Write the French and Japanese HTML help pages
- Design a nice website
