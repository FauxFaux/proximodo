<p class="section">Menu Items</p>

<p class="option">New</p>

<p class="explain">Creates a new filter with a default title.</p>

<p class="option">Duplicate</p>

<p class="explain">Creates a new filter with the same properties as
the current filter. The title will be "increased" ("(2)" is
appended) so that there are no duplicated titles.</p>

<p class="option">Delete</p>

<p class="explain">Deletes the selected filters from the list.
Indeed you can select several filters and delete them in one
time.</p>

<p class="option">Test</p>

<p class="explain">Opens a test window. This simple window offers
an editable text field where you would copy-paste some example html
code, and a Test button that will show the effect of edited filter
on the sample code. You can keep it open while you modify the
filter.</p>

<p class="option">Encode / Decode Base64</p>

<p class="explain">Transforms the content of clipboard. If you put
some plain text in the clipboard (e.g with Ctrl+C), use Encode
Base64 to encode it to the Base64 format. You can retrieve the
result with Ctrl+V. If you put a Base64-encoded string into the
clipboard, use Decode Base64 to decode it.</p>

<p class="option">Export</p>

<p class="explain">Exports the selected filters to the clipboard.
The filters are described in a specific text format that you would
better not edit manually. You can use this feature to save filters
in a text file or paste them in an e-mail so that you can exchange
them with your friends.</p>

<p class="option">Import</p>

<p class="explain">Imports the content of the clipboard. It should
contains filters as exported with the Export menu. In case you
already have filters with the same titles, imported filter titles
are increased (by appending "(2)").</p>

<p class="option">Import from Proxomitron</p>

<p class="explain">Imports the content of the clipboard, with the
difference that this only works if you put whole or part of a
Proxomitron .cfg file in the clipboard. Since Proxomitron filters
don't have categories or comments, you can easily locate them
(empty Category in the list) and edit the missing fields if you
like.</p>

<p class="option">Apply</p>

<p class="explain">Commits all modifications on filters since you
last applied/reverted them or opened the screen. If you save
settings using the menu, modifications are automatically applied.
If you leave the screen without doing it, Proximodo will prompt you
to know if you want to apply or lose them.</p>

<p class="option">Revert</p>

<p class="explain">Cancels all modifications on filters. Use it
when you inadvertently erased filters or fields and want them back.
But don't forget to apply settings regularly so that you don't lose
everything!</p>

<p class="section">Screen Items</p>

<p class="option">Filter List</p>

<p class="explain">This is the list of available filters. You can
click on one to see or edit its full description, or you can select
several lines to delete or export them in one time. Click on a
column header to sort the list.</p>

<p class="option">Title</p>

<p class="explain">This is the filter title, that appears in the
configurations or in the log window. The title is mandatory.
Proximodo makes sure there are never 2 filters with the same title
(it is increased when needed). Keep it short yet meaningful.</p>

<p class="option">Category</p>

<p class="explain">You can use this optional field to group your
filters and browse them more easily, since it is visible in the
filter list. Comes in handy when the list is very long.</p>

<p class="option">Comment</p>

<p class="explain">This optional comment explains what the filter
does. The comment is visible in the configuration list, so that you
can quickly remember what it does and decide to use it or not in a
given configuration. Do not neglect it.</p>

<p class="option">Author</p>

<p class="explain">If you want to trace filters' author, put your
name or pseudo in. Just please don't modify the field for filters
someone else wrote.</p>

<p class="option">Version</p>

<p class="explain">You can use this optional field to version your
filters, especially in case you make them public and may later
improve them.</p>

<p class="option">Filter Type</p>

<p class="explain">This field tells what kind of data the filter
deals with. It can be an outgoing header (sent by your browser to
the website), an incoming header (sent by the website in response
to the browser's request), or the text (html code) that your
browser downloads. In the case of header filters, the header name
must be provided (see below). In the case of text filters, window
width must be provided.</p>

<p class="option">Header Name</p>

<p class="explain">This is the name of the header the filter will
read and modify. It is case-insensitive. Wildcards or codes are not
allowed. For outgoing header filters, if the field starts with
"URL" (no matter what follows), the filter will read the requested
URL instead of a given header. Use this trick to test the URL and
possibly alter it (acting like a transparent redirection) or call
$commands.</p>

<p class="option">Window Width</p>

<p class="explain">This is the size of text that the filter reads
when it tries to match at a given position. You should keep it as
small as possible while allowing matches to be detected. For
example, if your match pattern is <span class=
"example">border=$AV(\1)</span> a width of 20 would be enough (a
border attribute and its value are never more than 20 characters
long).</p>

<p class="option">Allow Multiple Matches</p>

<p class="explain">If you want to allow your filter to match some of
its own replacement strings, check this option: instead of sending
replacement text to the filter output, Proximodo will re-insert it
in the filter's own input buffer. This option should not be used
unless really needed, because a filter that is not meant to recurse
could output unexpected things. Hopefully, Proximodo has an
infinite loop prevention mechanism.</p>

<p class="option">URL Pattern</p>

<p class="explain">If this field contains a pattern and the URL
does not match, the filter will be bypassed, i.e it will not try
and match anything in this header/text. Use this field when you
want the filter to work only on specific URLs. Common patterns are
<span class="example">$LST(someList)</span>, <span class=
"example">(^$LST(someList))</span> or <span class=
"example">$TYPE(htm)</span></p>

<p class="option">Bounds Pattern</p>

<p class="explain">If this field contains a pattern, the matching
process will have two passes: 1- search the bounds pattern, 2- if
an occurence is found, try and match the whole occurence with the
match pattern. This is as if you used as a match pattern <span
class="example">(bounds)&amp;&amp;(match)</span>. Simply it makes
things clearer. Use a bounds pattern when you can, as it makes
scanning faster, and sometimes better! For example to match an
&lt;img&gt; tag containing ".gif", you could use bounds: <span
class="example">&lt;img\s*&gt;</span> and match: <span class=
"example">*.gif*</span>. If you simply use the match pattern <span
class="example">&lt;img\s*.gif*&gt;</span> it would eat genuine
text and put half the page in italic if the page contains<br>
<span class="extext">&lt;i&gt;&lt;img src="bullet.jpg"&gt;Some .gif
images are animated&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>

<p class="option">Match Pattern</p>

<p class="explain">This is the pattern for finding occurrences to
replace within text. For a text filter, this pattern will be tried
starting on each and every position in the html code. For a header
filter, it is tried starting on the beginning of the header value
(e.g you must use <span class="example">*nasty</span> and not just
<span class="example">nasty</span> to match the Host header's
value <span class="extext">www.nasty.com</span>).</p>

<p class="option">Replacement Text</p>

<p class="explain">This field can contain plain text, replacement
codes and replace-compatible commands. Replacement codes are
computed and commands are executed in order to produce an "expanded
text". For text filters, each occurrence is replaced by this
expanded text. For header filters, the whole header value is
replaced by the expanded text.</p>
