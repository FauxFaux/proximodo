<p class="section">Buttons</p>

<p class="option">Apply</p>

<p class="explain">This will apply your changes. In fact, the proxy
server continues running with the same settings until you press
this button (or use the menu item). If you change screen or
minimize the window, Proximodo will prompt you for applying the new
settings, otherwise your modifications are lost. If you save the
settings using the menu, your changes are also applied.</p>

<p class="option">Revert</p>

<p class="explain">By clicking this button, your modifications on
the settings in this screen are lost. Use it if you think you
mistyped something (e.g losing your list names or proxy addresses)
and want to get the settings back to their values when you opened
the screen or last applied the settings.</p>

<p class="section">Filtering Settings</p>

<p class="option">Filter Outgoing Headers</p>

<p class="explain">If this box is unchecked, outgoing headers (that
is, headers included in the requests your browser sends to
websites) will not be affected by filters. If the box is checked,
headers may be changed / added / deleted by a header filter that
matches it. Note that Proximodo being a proxy server, it may change
a few proxy-related headers for its proper functioning, whether the
box is checked or not.</p>

<p class="option">Filter Incoming Headers</p>

<p class="explain">If this box is unchecked, incoming headers
(headers that websites send along with html documents and images)
are not affected by header filters. If the box is checked, headers
may be changed / added / deleted by header filters in the current
configuration.</p>

<p class="option">Filter Text</p>

<p class="explain">If this box is unchecked, downloaded html
documents are left untouched. If checked, the documents go through
all text filters in the current configuration. Those filters are
chained, and they may replace bits of text or not. The document's
content is then sent to the browser for viewing.</p>

<p class="option">Freeze GIF Images</p>

<p class="explain">If this box is checked, animated GIF images will
be transformed into fixed GIF images. Use this when flashy blinking
images all over the screen make you dizzy.</p>

<p class="option">Active Configuration</p>

<p class="explain">This is the active configuration for header/text
processing. A configuration is a set of selected filters that you
want to use. Proximodo comes with many filters, and you can add
more, but hopefully they are not all being used at the same time.
Instead, you can select the filters you want to use and "group"
them in a configuration. You can create several configurations, so
that switching from one set to another (for example for a set of
very unforgiving filters to a more permissive one) comes just to
changing the value of this setting.</p>

<p class="option">Bypass URL Pattern</p>

<p class="explain">This field contains a pattern for selecting
pages that must not be filtered at all. If the URL of a
document/image matches this pattern, no filter from the current
configuration will alter the request, response or document.
Meanwhile, all other pages will be filtered with regard to above
settings. The default is <span class="example">$URL(Bypass)</span>,
which means every pattern in the "Bypass" list (see Lists below)
will be tried. This is more powerful and flexible than enumerating
pages in this tiny text field! If there is a page or website you
want to leave untouched, add a line in the Bypass list once and for
all instead of deactivating/reactivating Proximodo filters.</p>

<p class="section">GUI Settings</p>

<p class="option">Language</p>

<p class="explain">This is the language for the graphical
interface, filter titles and comments. Changes will take effect
upon next restart (i.e by quitting/reloading Proximodo).</p>

<p class="option">Show GUI on startup</p>

<p class="explain">If you uncheck this box, Proximodo window will
not show when you start the program. You will have to click on the
system tray icon (bottom-right of your screen) to open the window
when you need it. Once you have customized filters and
configurations, you may want to uncheck this box so that you don't
have to minimize the window every time Proximodo starts.</p>

<p class="section">Proxy Settings</p>

<p class="option">Port</p>

<p class="explain">This is the port Proximodo is listening to.
Choose any value between 1024 and 65535 (but 8080 or 8088 are the
standard), then put that value in your browser's Proxy parameters,
along with the 'localhost' host (or your computer's IP address for
distant connections to Proximodo). You may have to configure your
firewall for letting Proximodo through.</p>

<p class="option">Use a remote Proxy</p>

<p class="explain">When this box is checked, Proximodo will access
Internet through the selected proxy. If not, Proximodo will
directly connect to the Internet using the Internet connection
available on the local computer. See Proxy below.</p>

<p class="option">Proxy</p>

<p class="explain">If you want/need to access the Internet via
another proxy server, put its host:port value in this field. You
would do that if your computer is not directly connected to the
internet, but through a local network. You can select a proxy from
those you previously entered in this field, by using the dropdown.
This dropdown list is also used by your custom filters containing a
$USEPROXY command. To add a proxy to the list, simply type the
host:port value in the field and type [Enter]. To delete a proxy
from the list, select it with the dropdown then click the trash
button on the right. If you are setting Proximodo up for the first
time, you might want to use the proxy values currently set in your
browser's parameters, before replacing those by localhost:8080</p>

<p class="option">Allow IP Range</p>

<p class="explain">If this box is unchecked, only programs running
on the local computer can connect to Proximodo. If checked,
connections attempts from distant computers may be accepted (if the
client's IP is within the following range). Use with caution, only
if you really want to grant Internet access to other users on your
local network (for example children).</p>

<p class="option">Range starts/stops at</p>

<p class="explain">If the 'Allow IP Range' box is checked, these
two values delimit IP addresses from which connections will be
accepted. Make it as narrow as possible, depending on your local
network.</p>

<p class="section">Lists Settings</p>

<p class="option">Name</p>

<p class="explain">Lists are in fact files loaded into memory,
whose lines are patterns that can be tried one after another by the
$LST filter command. This is a very powerful feature, as it allows
to share patterns between filters, and make them dynamic: you can
add manually or automatically new patterns to a list, and they are
instantly taken into account by filters that use it. Plus they can
be hundreds of lines, while the filters can remain small and
unchanged.<br>
- To add a new list, click on the Plus button then type a name then
a file path (or choose the file with the Folder button).<br>
- To rename a list, select it with the dropdown then modify the
name and type [Enter].<br>
- To delete a list, select it with the dropdown then erase the name
and type [Enter].<br>
- To view / edit the content of a list, select it then click on the
little magnifying glass button on the right.</p>

<p class="option">File</p>

<p class="explain">The file path for the selected list. You can
type it in, or choose a file (existing or new) with the Folder
button. If the file does not exist, Proximodo asks you if you want
the file to be created (with you should accept).</p>
