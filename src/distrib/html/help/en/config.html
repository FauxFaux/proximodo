<p class="section">Screen Items</p>

<p class="option">Filter List (left)</p>

<p class="explain">This is the exhaustive list of available
filters, as defined in the 'Filters' screen. You can sort the list
by clicking on a column header.</p>

<p class="option">Name</p>

<p class="explain">Select a configuration by clicking on the
dropdown button (the active configuration is displayed by default).
Then the set of active filters in that configuration appears in the
list below. You can rename the configuration by typing its new name
in the field then pressing [Enter].</p>

<p class="option">Active Filters (right)</p>

<p class="explain">Here appears the list of filters that will be
used in the configuration you are currently editing. Note that 1)
text filters will run in the order they appear in this list, 2) you
can use a filter several times in the same configuration (though
you don't need to with default filters). Select one or more filters
in a list then click arrow buttons (or the menu items) to
add/remove/move filters in the list.</p>

<p class="option">Buttons</p>

<p class="explain">Those 4 buttons only change the right list (R),
not the left list (L) which you can only modify through the
'Filters' screen. The Up and Down buttons move selected (R) filters
one row up or down. The Right button inserts selected (L) filters
into right list, just before the highlighted filter (else at
bottom). The Left button removes selected (R) filters. Note that
modifications will only be effective when you apply them using the
menu item.</p>

<p class="option">Filter Comment (bottom)</p>

<p class="explain">This read-only field displays the selected
filter's comment, so that you can remember what it does and decide
if you need it or not in the edited configuration.</p>

<p class="section">Menu Items</p>

<p class="option">Add / Remove / Move Up / Move Down</p>

<p class="explain">Those 4 menu items correspond to the 4 arrow
buttons.</p>

<p class="option">New</p>

<p class="explain">Creates a new empty configuration with a default
name that you can change at once.</p>

<p class="option">Duplicate</p>

<p class="explain">Creates a new configuration with the same
filters as in the previously shown configuration.</p>

<p class="option">Delete</p>

<p class="explain">Deletes the edited configuration. Note that if
you delete the last configuration, a empty one will be
automatically created.</p>

<p class="option">Apply</p>

<p class="explain">Use this when you want to commit your
modifications. If you leave the screen without applying changes
first, Proximodo will prompt you to apply them or lose them. Also,
if you save settings using the menu, modifications are
automatically applied.</p>

<p class="option">Revert</p>

<p class="explain">Cancel pending modifications. Use it when you
altered the configurations unwillingly.</p>
