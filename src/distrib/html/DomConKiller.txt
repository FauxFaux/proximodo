DOM based banner filters v0.007: 
From Proxomitron by Scott R. Lemmon
-----------------------------------

This javascript tries to kill most ads and the table
elements that contain them closing most of the empty
space normally left behind. To work it needs a DOM 
compliant browser.  Right now this includes IE 5.5 
and up or Mozilla 1.x or Netscape 6 or up.  Unfortunately
Opera's DOM support doesn't yet allow for page modification.

HOW TO ADJUST:

You can make the filter kill more or less by adjusting the
"KillScore" value on the first line. 25 is the default, but
higher values will kill more and lower vlaues will kill
less. Beware if you crank it too high, large parts of a 
page may go missing!

For more advanced tuning you can mess with the PDomScore() 
function. This gives different page elements different "non-spam"
scores. Most elements score +1 by default, but long lines of
text score an additional +1 for every 40 characters while 
text with certain ad keywords scores a -10. A high score makes
something *less* likely to be killed, while a low (or even
negative) score, make it more likely to get the ax.
You can adjust the score of any individual element, or add
scores for other other page elements too.
