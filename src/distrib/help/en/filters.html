<p class="section">Menu Items</p>

<p class="option">Test</p>

<p class="explain">Opens a test window. This simple window offers
an editable text field where you would copy-paste some example html
code, and a Test button that will show the effect of edited filter
on the sample code. You can keep it open while you modify the
filter.</p>

<p class="option">Encode / Decode Base64</p>

<p class="explain">Transforms the content of clipboard. If you put
some plain text in the clipboard (e.g with Ctrl+C), use Encode
Base64 to encode it to the Base64 format. You can retrieve the
result with Ctrl+V. If you put a Base64-encoded string into the
clipboard, use Decode Base64 to decode it.</p>

<p class="section">Screen Items</p>

<p class="option">Title</p>

<p class="explain">This is the filter title, that appears in the
configurations or in the log window. The title is mandatory.
Proximodo makes sure there are never 2 filters with the same title
(it is increased when needed). Keep it short yet meaningful.</p>

<p class="option">Author</p>

<p class="explain">If you want to trace filters' author, put your
name or pseudo in. Just please don't modify the field for filters
someone else wrote.</p>

<p class="option">Version</p>

<p class="explain">You can use this optional field to version your
filters, especially in case you make them public and may later
improve them.</p>

<p class="option">Comment</p>

<p class="explain">This optional comment explains what the filter
does. The comment is visible in the configuration list, so that you
can quickly remember what it does and decide to use it or not in a
given configuration. Do not neglect it.</p>

<p class="option">Priority</p>

<p class="explain">This arbitrary number defines the order in which
active filters are executed. Higher priority filters are executed
first (e.g a filter with priority 200 is executed before a filter
with priority 100). This order is very important: for example, if you
use a filter that removes some JavaScripts and a filter that inserts
a JavaScript, the former must run first, or it would undo the effect
of the latter. Default filters' priorities are defined so that no
such interference occur (from 1000 down to 0). When you write a new
filter, you should choose a priority consistent with your custom
filters and default filters too. A good practice is to use
priorities over 500 for filters that remove parts of html code, and
lower than 500 for filters that insert html code. Notes: 1/ you can
use negative numbers. 2/ filters can have the same priority if
their order does not matter. 3/ outgoing filters, incoming filters
and text filters are three independent groups.</p>

<p class="option">Window Width</p>

<p class="explain">This is the size of text that the filter reads
when it tries to match at a given position. You should keep it as
small as possible while allowing matches to be detected. For
example, if your match pattern is <span class=
"example">border=$AV(\1)</span> a width of 20 would be enough (a
border attribute and its value are never more than 20 characters
long).</p>

<p class="option">Allow Multiple Matches</p>

<p class="explain">Usually, when a filter finds an occurrence,
the replacement text is sent to the browser and the scanning
continues after the occurrence. Neither the filter, nor other
filters, will scan the replacement text. But if you check this
option, the replacement text replaces the occurrence in the
memory buffer, and the following filters will scan it. The filter
will be able to match its own replacement text (except the first
character, since the scanning process will have moved a byte to
the right when the filter tries and matches again.) Use this option
only when you really need it, for example when you have several
filters that are supposed to match and modify the same tag.</p>

<p class="option">Filter Type</p>

<p class="explain">This field tells what kind of data the filter
deals with. It can be an outgoing header (sent by your browser to
the website), an incoming header (sent by the website in response
to the browser's request), or the text (html code) that your
browser downloads. In the case of header filters, the header name
must be provided (see below). In the case of text filters, window
width must be provided.</p>

<p class="option">Header Name</p>

<p class="explain">This is the name of the header the filter will
read and modify. It is case-insensitive. Wildcards or codes are not
allowed. For outgoing header filters, if the field starts with
"URL" (no matter what follows), the filter will read the requested
URL (including :// part) instead of a given header. Use this trick
to test the URL and possibly alter it (acting like a transparent
redirection) or call $commands.</p>

<p class="option">URL Pattern</p>

<p class="explain">If this field contains a pattern and the URL
(without :// part) does not match, the filter will be bypassed, i.e it
will not try and match anything in this header/text. Use this field
when you want the filter to work only on specific URLs. Common patterns
are <span class="example">$LST(someList)</span>, <span class=
"example">(^$LST(someList))</span> or <span class=
"example">$TYPE(htm)</span></p>

<p class="option">Bounds Pattern</p>

<p class="explain">If this field contains a pattern, the matching
process will have two passes: 1- search the bounds pattern, 2- if
an occurence is found, try and match the whole occurence with the
match pattern. This is as if you used as a match pattern <span
class="example">(bounds)&amp;&amp;(match)</span>. Simply it makes
things clearer. Use a bounds pattern when you can, as it makes
scanning faster, and sometimes better! For example to match an
&lt;img&gt; tag containing ".gif", you could use bounds: <span
class="example">&lt;img\s*&gt;</span> and match: <span class=
"example">*.gif*</span>. If you simply use the match pattern <span
class="example">&lt;img\s*.gif*&gt;</span> it would eat genuine
text and put half the page in italic if the page contains<br>
<span class="extext">&lt;i&gt;&lt;img src="bullet.jpg"&gt;Some .gif
images are animated&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>

<p class="option">Match Pattern</p>

<p class="explain">This is the pattern for finding occurrences to
replace within text. For a text filter, this pattern will be tried
starting on each and every position in the html code. For a header
filter, it is tried starting on the beginning of the header value
(e.g you must use <span class="example">*nasty</span> and not just
<span class="example">nasty</span> to match the Host header's value
<span class="extext">www.nasty.com</span>).</p>

<p class="option">Replacement Text</p>

<p class="explain">This field can contain plain text, replacement
codes and replace-compatible commands. Replacement codes are
computed and commands are executed in order to produce an "expanded
text". For text filters, each occurrence is replaced by this
expanded text. For header filters, the whole header value is
replaced by the expanded text.</p>
