<p class="section">Filtering Options</p>

<p class="option">Filter Outgoing Headers</p>

<p class="explain">If this box is unchecked, outgoing headers (that
is, headers included in the requests your browser sends to
websites) will not be affected by filters. If the box is checked,
headers may be changed / added / deleted by a header filter that
matches it. Note that Proximodo being a proxy server, it may change
a few proxy-related headers for its proper functioning, whether the
box is checked or not.</p>

<p class="option">Filter Incoming Headers</p>

<p class="explain">If this box is unchecked, incoming headers
(headers that websites send along with html documents and images)
are not affected by header filters. If the box is checked, headers
may be changed / added / deleted by header filters in the current
configuration.</p>

<p class="option">Filter Text</p>

<p class="explain">If this box is unchecked, downloaded html
documents are left untouched. If checked, the documents go through
all text filters in the current configuration. Those filters are
chained, and they may replace bits of text or not. The document's
content is then sent to the browser for viewing.</p>

<p class="option">Freeze GIF Images</p>

<p class="explain">If this box is checked, animated GIF images will
be transformed into fixed GIF images. Use this when flashy blinking
images all over the screen make you dizzy.</p>

<p class="option">Active Configuration</p>

<p class="explain">This is the active configuration for header/text
processing. A configuration is a set of selected filters that you
want to use. Proximodo comes with many filters, and you can add
more, but hopefully they are not all being used at the same time.
Instead, you can select the filters you want to use and "group"
them in a configuration. You can create several configurations, so
that switching from one set to another (for example for a set of
very unforgiving filters to a more permissive one) comes just to
changing the value of this setting.</p>

<p class="section">Statistics</p>

<p class="option">Running Requests</p>

<p class="explain">This is the number of pages or files being
currently downloaded from the Internet. When zero, Proximodo is
idle, even though there may still be open connections
(persistent connections are used to improve Internet access time).</p>

<p class="option">Open Connections</p>

<p class="explain">This is the number of connections (sockets)
still alive between browser windows and Proximodo.</p>

<p class="option">Abort Button</p>

<p class="explain">It will close all connections, thus stopping
downloads. Use it if you want to interrupt a frozen download without
exiting the browser. Note that Proximodo continues to accept new
connections, the button does not stop the proxy server.</p>
