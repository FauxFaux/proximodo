<p class="option">Start / Stop</p>

<p class="explain">When you click on Start, events generated by
Proximodo will be shown in the log window (according to options).
If you click on stop, events are not caught by the log window
anymore (they will be lost) and you will be able to read the
content peacefully. When you close the window, it is turned off
automatically.</p>

<p class="option">Clear</p>

<p class="explain">Click here whenever you want to empty the
window.</p>

events generated by the HTTP monitoring engine. See the next two
options.</p>

<p class="option">View POST Data</p>
