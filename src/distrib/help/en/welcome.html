<p class="section">Thank you for giving a try to Proximodo!</p>

<p>Proximodo is still in early development stage, so you are
invited to report bugs and misbehaviours to kuruden@users.sourceforge.net .
Also, check once and a while Sourceforge.net for updates.</p>

<p>I encourage you to have a look at the GNU GPL license under
which Proximodo is distributed, as it comes with no warranty of any
kind and you will use it at your own risk. This includes
instructions present in these help pages.</p>

<p class="section">What does it do?</p>

<p>When you access the Internet with your web browser, a lot of
things happen that are hidden to you. The browser and the website
exchange "headers" that define the behaviour of the browser's cache
system, create or use cookies, tell the website who you are and
where you came from, and so on. Moreover, the page's html code
contains hidden tags or javascript programs that control the
browser's behaviour, such as "mouse-over" animation, page layering,
URL masking or pop-up messages. And last but not least, the page
often contains ads and banners that pollute the screen and slow
down your web experience.</p>

<p>Proximodo acts as a mediator between the browser and the
website. It "sees" everything that is going on and, according to
your choices, modifies headers and html page content on-the-fly to
make things right. You don't want pop-ups and banners? Just
activate the corresponding filters and they will disappear. You
want cookies to be deleted when you close your browser? Proximodo
will do it for you. You want a fast navigation in the pages you
already visited? Page caching will be forced.</p>

<p>Basically, Proximodo is a clone of a great piece of software
called The Proxomitron, developed by Scott R. Lemmon. Now that
for sad reasons Proxomitron is unmaintained, I started this
project to carry on the idea. Though a few Proxomitron
features are still missing in Proximodo (mainly SSL support)
the essential is already there:
100% of Proxomitron filters will run under Proximodo.</p>

<p>Proximodo currently comes with default Proxomitron filters,
which can do quite a lot of different things. But you can write
your own filters, using a powerful syntax that, despite its seeming
complexity, is quite easy to use and master.</p>

<p class="section">How to install it</p>

<p>If you are reading this page, you may already be executing
Proximodo. What you want to do now is customize the listening port,
which is 8080 by default, but it may be already used by another
previously installed local proxy. In this case, you can change
Proximodo port to 8088 or anything else (preferably above 1024).
This setting is accessible in Proximodo settings (Settings button
or in Tools menu). Then apply the settings and/or save them.</p>

<p>Now, you need to configure your browser to tell it to go through
Proximodo. For example, if you are using Internet Explorer, go into
menu Tools - Internet Options - Connections tab. Then press button
Settings or LAN Settings and locate "Proxy Server" settings, then
click "Advanced" button. On HTTP line, if Address/Port fields are
already filled, write those values down and copy them in Proximodo
settings (put <span class="extext">address:port</span> in "Proxy"
field and check "Use a remote proxy", then apply). Now, in IE
settings, put <span class="extext">localhost</span> in "Address"
field and Proximodo's Port value in "Port" field. Proximodo is a
HTTP proxy only, so you might want to let your previous proxy
server on the other lines (Secure/FTP/Gopher/Sock) or leave them
empty to keep a direct connection to the Internet.</p>

<p>If you are using another web browser, such as Mozilla or Opera,
same instructions apply but the proxy settings are located in your
browser's preferences.</p>

<p><span class="note">Important note:</span> Write down your old
settings and keep them safe, as you will set them back in your
browser's preferences when you uninstall Proximodo!</p>

<p>Now try and open a web page with your browser. If it does not
work, please check your browser's help or Proximodo forum on
Sourceforge.net. Then, you can customize Proximodo by selecting
what filters you want to use (menu Tools/Configurations). See the
other pages of the help to find out how.</p>

<p><span class="note">Note</span> concerning banner filtering:
Proximodo does not include an extensive list of forbidden URLs. But
you can find such lists in forums or personal web pages that deal
with Proximodo or Proxomitron. Have a search on google for
"proxomitron deny list". To add your own filtered URLs, open and
add lines to the default "AdList" list.</p>

<p>Finally, you can put a link to Proximodo.exe in your
"Startup" sub-menu (inside the Start menu) so that Proximodo
starts automatically when you reboot. Otherwise, don't forget
to launch Proximodo before using your browser!</p>
