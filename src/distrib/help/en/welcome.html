<p class="section">Thank you for trying Proximodo!</p>

<p><em>For the impatient...</em> If you are in a big hurry, here's
the <a href="#use">quick-start guide</a>.</p>

<p>Proximodo is still in development, so you are
invited to report bugs and problems to kuruden@users.sourceforge.net .
Also, check the 
<a href="http://proximodo.sf.net">Proximodo home page</a> periodically 
for updates.</p>

<p>I encourage you to have a look at the GNU GPL license under
which Proximodo is distributed, as it comes with no warranty of any
kind and you use it at your own risk. This includes
instructions present in these help pages.</p>

<p class="section">What does it do?</p>

<p>When you access the Internet with your web browser, a lot of
things happen that are hidden to you. The browser and the website
exchange "headers" that define the behaviour of the browser's cache
system, create or use cookies, tell the website who you are and
where you came from, and so on. Further, the page's html code
contains hidden tags or javascript programs that control the
browser's behaviour, such as "mouse-over" animation, page layering,
URL masking or pop-up messages. And last but not least, the page
often contains ads and banners that pollute the screen and slow
down your web experience.</p>

<p>Proximodo acts as a mediator between the browser and the
website. It "sees" everything that is going on and, according to
your choices, modifies headers and html page content on-the-fly to
make things right. You don't want pop-ups and banners? Just
activate the corresponding filters and they will disappear. You
want cookies to be deleted when you close your browser? Proximodo
will do it for you. You want fast navigation to the pages you
already visited? Proximodo will cache them.</p>

<p>Proximodo is a clone of a great piece of software
called The Proxomitron, developed by Scott R. Lemmon. Now that
for sad reasons Proxomitron is no longer maintained, I started this
project to carry on the idea. Though a few Proxomitron
features are still missing in Proximodo (mainly SSL support)
the essential feature is already there:
100% of Proxomitron filters will run under Proximodo.</p>

<p>Proximodo currently comes with default Proxomitron filters,
which can do quite a lot of different things. You can also write
your own filters, using a powerful syntax that, despite its seeming
complexity, is quite easy to use and master.</p>

<a name="install"></a>
<p class="section">How to install it</p>

<p>These installation instructions apply only to Windows, as this is
the only platform for which we currently supply an end-user installation
package. We would welcome assistance with installation packages for Linux, 
Unix, and Macintosh.</p>

<p>If you are reading this page, you have probably already downloaded 
and executed an installer <span class="extext">.exe</span> file from the 
<a href="http://proximodo.sf.net">Proximodo home page</a>. If not, do this 
now, and the installer will guide you through installation.</p>

<p>There is one further step you may need to take after running the
installer: configuring your browser. For most users, the installer 
offers to automatically configure Internet Explorer to use Proximodo -
if you accepted this option, you can skip the rest of this section and
go on to <a href="#use">How to use it</a>. Users who 
already have a proxy configured are not offered this option, and it
does not help users of other browsers such as Firefox; if you fall
into either of these categories, follow the instructions below.</p>

<p>If you are using Internet Explorer, go into the menu 
Tools - Internet Options - Connections tab. Then press 
Settings or LAN Settings and locate "Proxy Server" settings, then
click "Advanced" button. On the HTTP line, if Address/Port fields are
already filled in, write those values down and copy them into Proximodo
settings (put <span class="extext">address:port</span> in "Proxy"
field and check "Use a remote proxy", then click Apply). Now, in IE
settings, put <span class="extext">localhost</span> in "Address"
field and Proximodo's Port value in "Port" field. Proximodo is a
HTTP proxy only, so do not change the settings on the other lines 
(Secure/FTP/Gopher/Sock).</p>

<p>If you are using another web browser, such as Mozilla or Opera,
same instructions apply but the proxy settings are located in your
browser's preferences. For instance, in Firefox, navigate to
<span class="extext">about:config</span> and adjust the proxy settings.</p>

<p><span class="note">Important note:</span> Write down your old
settings and keep them safe, as you will need to restore them in your
browser if you ever uninstall Proximodo!</p>

<a name="use"></a>
<p class="section">How to use it - quick start</p>

<p>Instead of starting your browser, start Proximodo instead, for instance
by double-clicking its icon <img src="../../html/favicon.ico"/> on your
desktop. Proximodo starts your browser, and the browser uses Proximodo to 
filter its data. Want to open another copy of your browser, perhaps to
view another web page at the same time? Just start Proximodo again - you
can do this as many times as you like, to start many copies of your browser.</p>

<p><em>Warning:</em> if you start the browser on its own, and Proximodo 
is not running, the browser will not work - you'll get strange errors
about proxies not being present. To avoid this, just get in the habit 
of double-clicking Proximodo instead of your browser.</p>

<p><em>If this doesn't work</em>: You may need to configure proxy settings.
Read the <a href="#install">installation instructions</a> to see how to do
this.</p>

<p>Running Proximodo this way gives you some protection against the
worst web annoyances. To get the most out of Proximodo, read the next
section to see how to use Proximodo screens to adjust its behaviour.</p>

<p class="section">How to use it - adjusting Proximodo</p>

<p>If you want to enable filters, write filters, or change settings, you
need to see Proximodo screens. If you run with the quick-start method
above, you'll never see these screens (except for the very first time
you run Proximodo, when it shows itself to say hello). So what do you
do?</p>

<p><em>To make occasional adjustments</em>, first launch Proximodo as
normal, then click its icon <img src="../../html/favicon.ico"/> 
in the system tray (normally at the lower right of your screen). 
<em>(Note this is Windows-specific - can someone please help with 
corresponding Linux, Unix, and Macintosh directions?)</em></p>

<p><em>If you tinker regularly</em>, you may want to change the startup
settings so that Proximodo launches its screens on startup. See the
<a href="settings.html">settings screen help</a> for details.</p>

<p>The other sections of this help guide explain how to use Proximodo
screens to adjust its behaviour. You can turn off all adverts, write
your own filters, and more! Just click the icons above to see how.</p>

<p><span class="note">Note</span> concerning banner filtering:
Proximodo does not include an extensive list of forbidden URLs. But
you can find such lists in forums or personal web pages that deal
with Proximodo or Proxomitron. Have a search on google for
"proxomitron deny list". To add your own filtered URLs, open and
add lines to the default "AdList" list.</p>
