<p class="section">Buttons</p>

<p class="option">Apply</p>

<p class="explain">This will apply your changes. In fact, the proxy
server continues running with the same settings until you press
this button (or use the menu item). If you change screen or
minimize the window, Proximodo will prompt you for applying the new
settings, otherwise your modifications are lost. If you save the
settings using the menu, your changes are also applied.</p>

<p class="option">Revert</p>

<p class="explain">By clicking this button, your modifications on
the settings in this screen are lost. Use it if you think you
mistyped something (e.g losing your list names or proxy addresses)
and want to get the settings back to their values when you opened
the screen or last applied the settings.</p>

<p class="section">Filtering Settings</p>

<p class="option">Bypass URL Pattern</p>

<p class="explain">This field contains a pattern for selecting
pages that must not be filtered at all. If the URL (without :// part)
of a document/image matches this pattern, no filter from the current
configuration will alter the request, response or document.
Meanwhile, all other pages will be filtered with regard to above
settings. The default is <span class="example">$LST(Bypass)</span>,
which means every pattern in the "Bypass" list (see Lists below)
will be tried. This is more powerful and flexible than enumerating
pages in this tiny text field! If there is a page or website you
want to leave untouched, add a line in the Bypass list once and for
all instead of deactivating/reactivating Proximodo filters.</p>

<p class="section">User Interface</p>

<p class="option">Language</p>

<p class="explain">This is the language for the graphical
interface, filter titles and comments. Changes will take effect
upon next restart (i.e by quitting/reloading Proximodo).</p>

<p class="option">Show GUI On Start-Up</p>

<p class="explain">By default, Proximodo window opens each
time Proximodo starts. If you only need the tray icon, uncheck
this checkbox. You will still be able to open the window, by
clicking on the icon in the system tray.</p>

<p class="option">Launch This App On Start-Up</p>

<p class="explain">By default, when Proximodo starts, it
automatically opens a browser window for you. You can change this
behaviour. Uncheck the checkbox to prevent Proximodo from opening
anything else. Or change the executable path, to launch another
program than the default browser (initially set to the browser
associated with the text/html MIME type). Use the folder button to
browse your hard drive.</p>

<p class="section">Proxy Settings</p>

<p class="option">Port</p>

<p class="explain">This is the port Proximodo is listening to.
Choose any value between 1024 and 65535 (but 8080 or 8088 are the
standard), then put that value in your browser's Proxy parameters,
along with the 'localhost' host (or your computer's IP address for
distant connections to Proximodo). You may have to configure your
firewall for letting Proximodo through.</p>

<p class="option">Enable URL commands</p>

<p class="explain">When you check this option, you can ask Proximodo
to do additional processing to a page by prefixing the domain with
a "URL command". Known URL commands are:
<ul>
<li><code>bin.. </code>: bypass incoming header filters for this page</li>
<li><code>bout.. </code>: bypass outgoing header filters for this page</li>
<li><code>bweb.. </code>: bypass text filters for this page</li>
<li><code>bypass.. </code>: bypass all filters for this page</li>
<li><code>dbug.. </code>: insert debug markers where filters are triggered</li>
<li><code>src.. </code>: display web page source code</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="option">Prefix</p>

<p class="explain">In order to prevent websites from using URL commands
to disable filters on their pages, you can customize the URL commands
with an additional prefix. For example, with the prefix <code>foo</code>
the URL command to bypass filters will become <code>foobypass..</code></p>

<p class="option">Use a remote Proxy</p>

<p class="explain">When this box is checked, Proximodo will access
Internet through the selected proxy. If not, Proximodo will
directly connect to the Internet using the Internet connection
available on the local computer. See Proxy below.</p>

<p class="option">Proxy</p>

<p class="explain">If you want/need to access the Internet via
another proxy server, put its host:port value in this field. You
would do that if your computer is not directly connected to the
internet, but through a local network. You can select a proxy from
those you previously entered in this field, by using the dropdown.
This dropdown list is also used by your custom filters containing a
$USEPROXY command. To add a proxy to the list, simply type the
host:port value in the field and type [Enter]. To delete a proxy
from the list, select it with the dropdown then click the trash
button on the right. If you are setting Proximodo up for the first
time, you might want to use the proxy values currently set in your
browser's parameters, before replacing those by localhost:8080</p>

<p class="option">Allow IP Range</p>

<p class="explain">If this box is unchecked, only programs running
on the local computer can connect to Proximodo. If checked,
connections attempts from distant computers may be accepted (if the
client's IP is within the following range). Use with caution, only
if you really want to grant Internet access to other users on your
local network (for example children).</p>

<p class="option">Range starts/stops at</p>

<p class="explain">If the 'Allow IP Range' box is checked, these
two values delimit IP addresses from which connections will be
accepted. Make it as narrow as possible, depending on your local
network.</p>

<p class="section">Lists Settings</p>

<p class="option">Name</p>

<p class="explain">Lists are in fact files loaded into memory,
whose lines are patterns that can be tried one after another by the
$LST filter command. This is a very powerful feature, as it allows
to share patterns between filters, and make them dynamic: you can
add manually or automatically new patterns to a list, and they are
instantly taken into account by filters that use it. Plus they can
be hundreds of lines, while the filters can remain small and
unchanged.<br>
- To add a new list, click on the Plus button then type a name then
a file path (or choose the file with the Folder button).<br>
- To rename a list, select it with the dropdown then modify the
name and type [Enter].<br>
- To delete a list, select it with the dropdown then erase the name
and type [Enter].<br>
- To view / edit the content of a list, select it then click on the
little magnifying glass button on the right.</p>

<p class="option">File</p>

<p class="explain">The file path for the selected list. You can
type it in, or choose a file (existing or new) with the Folder
button. If the file does not exist, Proximodo asks you if you want
the file to be created (with you should accept).</p>
