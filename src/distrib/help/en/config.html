<p class="section">Screen Items</p>

<p class="option">Name</p>

<p class="explain">Select a configuration by clicking on the
dropdown button (the active configuration is displayed by default).
Then checkboxes in the tree are updated to show which filters are
active in that configuration. You can rename the configuration by
typing its new name in the field then pressing [Enter].</p>

<p class="option">Tree of filters</p>

<p class="explain">The tree contains all available filters. They
are organised in folders, for an easier browsing and filter
checking. You can rename folders and filters by clicking twice on
an item. You can drag&amp;drop items to move them from a folder to
another. Typing [Enter] opens the filter edition window, that you
can keep open when you come back to the tree (the edition window
will always show the selected filter).</p>

<p class="option">Buttons</p>

They have exactly the same effect as menu items. See below for
details. 
<p class="option">Filter Comment (bottom)</p>

<p class="explain">This read-only field displays the selected
filter's comment, so that you can remember what it does and decide
if you need it or not in the edited configuration.</p>

<p class="section">Menu Items</p>

<p class="option">New Folder</p>

<p class="explain">Creates a new folder with a default title within
the selected folder.</p>

<p class="option">New Filter</p>

<p class="explain">Creates a new filter with a default title.</p>

<p class="option">Edit Filter</p>

<p class="explain">Opens the edition window, showing the selected
filter. That window can stay open while you come back to the main
window.</p>

<p class="option">Check</p>

<p class="explain">Same effect as clicking on a checkbox in the
tree.</p>

<p class="option">Delete</p>

<p class="explain">Deletes the selected filters or folders from the
list. You can select several filters and delete them in one
time.</p>

<p class="option">Export</p>

<p class="explain">Exports the selected filters to the clipboard.
The filters are described in a specific text format that you would
better not edit manually. You can use this feature to save filters
in a text file or paste them in an e-mail so that you can exchange
them with your friends.</p>

<p class="option">Import</p>

<p class="explain">Imports the content of the clipboard. It should
contains filters as exported with the Export menu. Filters are
inserted in the current folder.</p>

<p class="option">Import from Proxomitron</p>

<p class="explain">Imports the content of the clipboard, with the
difference that this only works if you put whole or part of a
Proxomitron .cfg file in the clipboard.</p>

<p class="option">New Config</p>

<p class="explain">Creates a new configuration with a default name
that you can change at once. All checkboxes will be off.</p>

<p class="option">Duplicate Config</p>

<p class="explain">Creates a new configuration with the same active
filters as in the previously shown configuration.</p>

<p class="option">Delete Config</p>

<p class="explain">Deletes the edited configuration. Note that if
you delete the last configuration, a new one will be automatically
created.</p>

<p class="option">Apply</p>

<p class="explain">Use this when you want to commit your
modifications. If you leave the screen without applying changes
first, Proximodo will prompt you to apply them or lose them. Also,
if you save settings using the menu, modifications are
automatically applied.</p>

<p class="option">Revert</p>

<p class="explain">Cancel all pending modifications. Use it when
you altered the configurations or filters unwillingly. There is
current no real 'undo' option, it may be available in an upcoming
version of Proximodo.</p>
