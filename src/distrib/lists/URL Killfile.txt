# Proxomitron Killfile
#
# The URL killer header filter, if enabled, will kill 
# any URLs matched in this list.  This will completely
# block access to the given site so be cautious.
#
# Note: the AdKey list also calls this list to give the
# banner filters a chance to block these items before
# they reach your browser.
#
# List Indexing:  New in Naoko-4 BetaFour is the ability
# to index some regular expressions. This can greatly speed
# lookup in large lists. No changes to existing lists are necessary
# but to fully take advantage of these features it helps to know
# what can and can't be indexed. This includes...
#
# 1) lines that begin without any wildcards can be index up to the
#    first wildcard.  As in "www.somesite.com/\w/ads.html"
#
# 2) URLs with specific leading wildcards and no further wildcards
#    for the rest of the hostname up to and including the first "/" 
#    For example...
#
#    *.somesite.com/
#    \w.somesite.com/
#    [^.]+.somesite.com/
#    [^/]++somesite.com/
#    ([^/]++.|)somesite.com/    
#    
#    Valid leading wildcards include *, \w, [...]+, [...]++, and (...|)
#    Note that you must include the "/" before any further wildcards. 
#    For instance, "[^.]+.somesite.(com|net)/" won't be indexable
#    because the host includes both leading and trailing wildcards.
