# This is used by several of Proxomitron's cookie filters

# Web Filters   :  Disable JavaScript (and meta) cookies

# Header Filters:  Set-cookie: Make all cookies session only (in)
#                  Set-cookie: Never accept cookies (In) 
#                  Cookie: Kill a cookie (out)             
#
# For basic cookie control using "Disable JavaScript (and meta) cookies" 
# and "Set-cookie: Make all cookies session only" works pretty well. 
# This will allow most cookies but make them temporary (and mostly harmless)
# 
# For a more hard line approach, use the "Set-cookie: Never accept cookies"
# and "Cookie: Kill a cookie" header filters in place of "session only"
# this will block all cookies not explicitly permitted in this list
