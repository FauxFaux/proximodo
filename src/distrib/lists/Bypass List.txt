##
## This is a list of URLs (web addresses) not to filter in Proxomitron 
##
## You can add any "problem" sites to this list or just any site you
## don't wish to filter here.
##
## As in other lists, you can use any matching expression wildcards.
## Also remember not to add "http://" in front of your URLs.
##
## NOTE: Since only the items that match the URL will be bypassed,
## images and banners on the page from other sites might still
## be filtered. If something is still being filtered that you don't
## want, look closely at the actual URL of the item and add it to
## the list too.
